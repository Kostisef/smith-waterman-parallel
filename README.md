# smith-waterman-parallel
A parallel implementation of Smith-Waterman algorithm for determining similar regions between two strings of nucleic acid sequences or protein sequences.

There three different aproaches:

* Serial (the standard implementation for taking measuerments as a baseline)
* Parallel using OpenMP library
* Parallel using OpenMP with Vectorization
